### 2020
1. **Spend less time on group chats**

    This is more arbitrary than I would like but I couldn't figure out how to make more tangible. So far so good, though. I exited a couple chats and muted the rest. I don't have that screen time tracker app but I'd say in general I've been more productive at home. Unclear if that's causation or correlation at this point but it's a positive result either way.

2. **Run 200 miles**

3. **Put shoes and coats away immediately when I get home**

    Ashlynn and I had developed a bad habit of leaving our shoes by the door and hanging our coats on the back of our kitchen chairs which are also close to the door. She's doing this one with me and so far we've done very well.

### 2019
1. **Go camping in NC once. Must sleep in tent (no glamping)**

    Done. Ashlynn, Bella and I camped out at a camp ground by the White Water Center in Charlotte on March 30th with our friends Ryan & Kate.

2. **4000 splat points at Orange Theory (about 122 classes at 33 per class)**

    Uhhhhh no. Finished the year with 2311 points. I was pretty new to Orange Theory when I came up with this goal. I failed to factor in that my points per class would drastically decrease as I got in better shape. I don't have the exact total but I'm very confident I attended far more than 122 classes, so this goal wasn't a total loss.

3. **Don't turn on the TV on Wednesdays**

    This just straight up failed. I thought I could cut back on screen time by electing one day a week to consciously not turn on the TV. This probably lasted about 8-10 weeks before being completely abandoned.

4. **Cook 6 new recipes**

    Done. I can't remember what they all were but between cookbooks, recipes from friends, and our own creations we hit this. Probably not but a lot though. My favorite one that I can remember was fajita stuffed bell peppers.
