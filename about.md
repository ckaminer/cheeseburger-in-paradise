Here's what my [resume](/assets/charles_kaminer_resume.pdf) has to say about me:
>I am a charismatic problem solver who strives to make code readable, testable, scalable, and fun to write. I appreciate working on small, iterative teams because they provide everyone with an opportunity to learn more about their product, customer, and each other.

But because this isn't a resume I'll indulge the "tell me about yourself" question a little more. I'm a former math nerd turned into a computer nerd. Don't get it twisted, I still love math and the story it can tell. Numbers still sooth me and probably always will. But I also enjoy building things and that's why I do what I do now.

Outside of that, I like to read, I like to write (welcome to my site), I like to learn about Bitcoin, I like to poke fun at myself, I like to poke fun at you, and I like hanging with Ashlynn and Bella.

I'm a New Englander so you'll get annoyed with my Red Sox and Patriots takes. On top of those two juggernauts I went to Clemson so I'm an all around spoiled sports fan.

Caddyshack and Good Will Hunting are the best movies of all time.
